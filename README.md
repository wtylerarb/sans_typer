This extension is heavily inspired by DageXVIII's *Animalese Typing* [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/animalese-typing/djbgadolfboockbofalipohdncimebic?hl=en&pli=1) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/animalese-typing/) extension, which is a similar concept, playing Animal Crossing Villager sound effects upon a keystroke.
